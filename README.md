- 👋 Hi, I’m @AngeElson
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about AI from an inclusion perspective.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build online communities to support regional and remote LGBTIQA+ communities.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on how we can build capacity in LGBTIQA+ leaders so they can use AI to innovate and collaborate to make change.
